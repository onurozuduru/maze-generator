# maze-generator
Simple maze generator and basic GUI in Java.

I explained codes in comments and I wrote a blog post about it which is [here](http://ozuduru.com/java/2016/02/10/recursive-backtracking-maze-generator-in-java-with-gui/).

I hope it helps your homeworks/projects. If you use these codes without changes in your works, 
I'd be happy if you put a link for my blog page [ozuduru.com](http://ozuduru.com) or my twitter account [@onurozuduru](https://twitter.com/onurozuduru) with my name on somewhere.
